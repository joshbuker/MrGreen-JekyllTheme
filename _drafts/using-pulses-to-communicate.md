# Using Pulses to Communicate

Intro, what do you do when you want to send a message and all you have is on and off.

Morse code, smoke signals, telegram, other early uses.

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

Duty cycles, good for percentage use-cases.

## Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)

Simplistic data packets, good for integer numbers. _very_ sensitive to timing inaccuracies.
